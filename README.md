# Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

An AI-powered Social Media Sentiment Analyzer developed using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
This project analyzes sentiments from **YouTube comments** and **X (Twitter) posts** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The application classifies comments into:

-  Positive  
-  Negative  
-  Neutral  

It also provides:
-  Sentiment Graphs
-  Trend Analysis
-  PDF Report Generation
-  Interactive Dashboard UI


#  Features
##  YouTube Sentiment Analysis
- Fetches real YouTube comments using YouTube Data API
- Performs sentiment classification
- Displays comments in separate tables:
  - Positive Comments
  - Negative Comments
  - Neutral Comments



⚠️ The X (Twitter) sentiment analysis module is currently under development.

At present, the module uses simulated/sample tweet data for demonstrating sentiment analysis functionality. Real-time tweet fetching and live API integration will be added in future updates.

### Planned Improvements
- Real-time X API integration
- Live tweet fetching
- Hashtag trend analysis
- Advanced sentiment prediction
- Better engagement analytics

This section is included for future scalability and enhancement of the project.
